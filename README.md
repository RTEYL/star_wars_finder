# StarWarsFinder

Welcome to Welcome to my Star Wars Finder gem. Using an API to collect character data you will be able to seach for a Star Wars character and get information about it. At this moment a character is only searchable by name however later updates will include search by planets and search by species.

## Installation
Fork/Clone this lab

Then execute:

    $ bin/run

`** gem has not been published to rubygems at this moment

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'star_wars_finder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install star_wars_finder

## Usage

Put `bin/run` in the command line and you'll be prompted with some top character choices to search by or enter your own search term. The search input is dynamic in that your term doesn't need to exactly match a characters name `chew => Chewbacca`, `luke => Luke Skywalker` etc..

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
